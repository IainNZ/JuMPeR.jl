**[JuMPeR]** is a modeling language for [robust optimization].
It is embedded in the [Julia programming language], and is an extension to the [JuMP] modeling language.

  - Install with Julia package manager: `julia> Pkg.add("JuMPeR")`.
  - [Read the (limited) documentation to learn more](doc/index.md).
    - Help with documentation is appreciated!
    - The JuMPeR chapter from my thesis is [also available](doc/JuMPeRChapter.pdf).
    - The source code is well-commented, if you'd like to understand more.
  - [Checkout the examples](example/).
